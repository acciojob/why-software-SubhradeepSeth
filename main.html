 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
 <p>Before answering the question there is a little flashback.
	 I am a mechanical engineer having 5 years of experience in my core field.
	 I have passed in the year 2017.Although i was working hard everyday i was not getting
	 enough challing work environment and not getting a sustainable carrer growth
	 over the period of time.Then i got introduced to coding.I did not know a single
	 word about coding so there is no question i had the capability to choose web developement
	 or any other part of cse.I was introduced to java so i started learning it and then after
	 coding for 7 months and after solving 200 basic dsa question i moved to software 
	 developement.Now at acciojob i loved the learning procedure.I loved web developement
	 after studying here and now trying to become a developer.</p>
